# ft_ssl
Learning things about encryption.

**THIS REPO IS A MESS**

The project will eventually be a sort of openssl clone, that takes various inputs and outputs them all encrypted-like.

However, it is currently in a horrible state of disrepair. I am very sorry.

It also currently contains the whole of [libft](https://github.com/naregjan/libft) as opposed to submodules because that makes it easier to work with, compatibility-wise, with the corresponding internal [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) repo.
